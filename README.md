# character-journal
A creative writing space to develop characters by a series of journal entries.

Watch each character develop over time by reading their journal entries, organized by directory.

## Process
- Each journal entry starts out in the `draft` branch. 
- Once editted and in its final form, this draft entry is promoted to the `final-edit` branch.
- An entry must remain in `final-edit` until approximately a week has passed, then a final editorial revision is done.
- Once the final revision is in place, the `approved` tag will be added.
- After this, the entry can be merged to `master`.
